Question,Answer
What is C++?,"C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed as an extension of C, providing object-oriented features."
What is a namespace in C++?,A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to identifiers to avoid naming conflicts.
What is the difference between C and C++?,"C++ supports object-oriented programming, while C is procedural. C++ also includes features like classes and objects."
What is OOP in C++?,"OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a paradigm based on classes and objects, supporting concepts like inheritance and polymorphism."
What is a class in C++?,A class is a blueprint for creating objects and defines properties and behaviors of objects.
What is an object in C++?,"An object is an instance of a class, representing an entity with data and functions."
Explain inheritance in C++.,Inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
What is polymorphism in C++?,"Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, with functions having different behaviors."
What is encapsulation?,Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods into a single unit or class.
What is abstraction?,Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only functionality to the user.
Define a constructor in C++.,"A constructor is a special function called when an object is instantiated, used to initialize objects."
What is a destructor in C++?,"A destructor is a special function that is called when an object is destroyed, used for cleanup."
What is function overloading?,Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
What is operator overloading?,Operator overloading allows operators to be defined for user-defined data types.
What is the difference between 'struct' and 'class'?,"In 'struct', members are public by default; in 'class', they are private by default."
What are access specifiers?,"Access specifiers (public, private, protected) control the visibility of class members."
What is the use of 'this' pointer?,'this' pointer refers to the current instance of a class.
"What is the difference between public, private, and protected?","Public allows access from outside the class, private restricts access, and protected allows access to derived classes."
What is an inline function?,An inline function is expanded at the point of invocation to reduce function call overhead.
What is a friend function?,A friend function can access private and protected members of a class.
What is a virtual function?,A virtual function is used to achieve runtime polymorphism in inheritance.
Explain pure virtual functions.,A pure virtual function has no implementation and makes a class abstract.
What is an abstract class?,An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function and cannot be instantiated.
What is dynamic binding?,Dynamic binding refers to linking a function call to the code to be executed at runtime.
Explain static binding.,Static binding links the function call to the code at compile time.
What is the purpose of 'new' and 'delete' operators?,"'new' allocates memory dynamically, while 'delete' frees dynamically allocated memory."
What is the role of 'const' keyword?,'const' keyword is used to define constant variables or prevent changes to data.
What is a reference in C++?,"A reference is an alias for another variable, often used for passing parameters."
What are templates in C++?,Templates allow writing generic programs that work with any data type.
What is exception handling?,"Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, catch, and throw."
What is a try-catch block?,"A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions, with 'try' to test code and 'catch' to handle errors."
What is the 'throw' keyword?,'throw' is used to signal the occurrence of an error or exception.
What is STL in C++?,STL (Standard Template Library) is a library providing data structures and algorithms.
What is a vector in C++?,A vector is a dynamic array that can resize itself when elements are added or removed.
What is a pointer in C++?,A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.
Explain the concept of memory management.,Memory management refers to allocation and deallocation of memory at runtime.
What is a linked list?,A linked list is a data structure where elements are nodes linked by pointers.
What is recursion?,Recursion is a function that calls itself to solve a problem in smaller instances.
What are function pointers?,Function pointers store the address of a function and can be used to invoke functions.
What is the difference between '==' and '===' operators in C++?,"'==' checks for equality, while '===' does not exist in C++ (only in some other languages)."
What is the 'static' keyword?,'static' keyword restricts visibility to the scope of its definition and persists value.
What is a static variable?,A static variable retains its value across function calls.
What is a static function?,A static function is restricted to the file or class in which it is defined.
What is type casting?,Type casting converts one data type to another.
What is a copy constructor?,A copy constructor initializes an object by copying another object of the same type.
What is a move constructor?,A move constructor transfers resources from a temporary object to a new one.
What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?,"Shallow copy copies only the address, while deep copy duplicates the entire data."
Explain the 'volatile' keyword.,'volatile' keyword prevents compiler optimization for specific variables.
What is a smart pointer?,A smart pointer manages memory automatically by using reference counting.
What is the use of 'nullptr' in C++?,'nullptr' is a keyword used to represent a null pointer in modern C++.
